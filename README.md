# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
### Main academic project
A Streamlit web app to detect diabetic retinopathy using a VGG16 deep learning model and visualize predictions with Grad-CAM. Includes PDF medical report generation and history tracking via SQLite.

Built an AI system to assist in early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy â€” a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients.
## Highlights:
- Preprocessed retinal fundus images
- Fine-tuned a VGG16 CNN model using PyTorch
- Applied data augmentation and early stopping for robust training
- Integrated Grad-CAM for saliency map visualization (model interpretability)
- Developed a Streamlit app with a user-friendly interface for predictions
- Used SQLite to store results (details, date, prediction, image)
- FPDF library for pdf generation of the report


## Features
- Upload retinal image and predict DR stage
- Visual explanation via Grad-CAM overlay
- Downloadable PDF report with medical summary
- SQLite-based history tracking
- Hosted on Streamlit Cloud

This project strengthened my skills in deep learning, medical imaging, and model deployment. Grateful for the opportunity to work on something that bridges AI with healthcare.
